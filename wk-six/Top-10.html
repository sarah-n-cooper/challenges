They exist. There is, for instance, Mitchell's daring handling of her men and their personae in the 1970s. Coyote from HEJIRA is a frank, cutting portrayal of lover Sam Shepard.

I discovered this song first from the Last Waltz film - The Band's famous last concert held on Thanksgiving. Joni was all youth, beauty and power on that stage, and she was mesmerising.

          <p class="w-100 mw6-ns helvetica lh-copy f-1">Bleeps transmitted from outer space, familiar syncopation and turntable scratches. When Beth Gibbons starts singing in a pinched, affected voice, "All Mine" begins like a hiccuping James Bond theme, but it turns out to be a tale of coolly detached possessiveness: "There's nowhere to hide from me..../All mine, you have to be."
            <br>
            <br>
            Also, let's talk about what sort of woman Beth Gibbons is - she was famously reclusive and hated performing live, much prefering to record from her living room at home. She would chain smoke all the way through shows. This woman was every introverted woman's hero for doing the things we could only dream of, and sounding awesomely dark and witchy while she did it.

The jazziness, the difference sort of cadence and flow based on the particular accent Ty had was fascinating. A gateway drug for the place that grime would later hold in my heart when I lived in the UK. </p>

        <div>
          <p class="w-100 mw6-ns helvetica lh-copy f-1">In a word, 1992. Air France respect Saint Etienne, and "Spring", too much to try to reinvent the wheel-- they're self-professed fans, and "Spring" is a song that "we fucked to when we were eleven and took rohypnol raw," so their revision is respectful to the source material in many ways. That is, except one-- in Air France's hands, the effervescent April showers of the original "Spring" are exchanged for a instantaneous full bloom. They don't necessarily rid the song of its alluring London fog (though they do forgo the song's relatively moody spoken-word bridges). Instead, Air France work around it, turning the drama in Sarah Cracknell's yearning ("Can't you see it's me who really loves you?") into something slightly more playful, and adding just enough percussive flourishes to give the song's beat a little more bounce. Essentially, Air France's makeover of this already gorgeous tune is a more palatable version of those obnoxious nerdy-turned-purty makeovers that features prominently in every coming-of-age drama. "Spring" didn't dress in frumpy sweaters, put its hair up in a bun, or wear (gasp!) glasses, but Air France know just how to cut the bangs and rouge the cheeks to make the song's beauty apparent to anyone within earshot.</p>

One of Camera Obscura's finest attributes is consistency. There's hardly a dud to be found in their catalog, and their similarly styled songs distinguish themselves the old-fashioned way-- with memorable melodies and unique lyrics. Best save this song for last, because the horn fade out is brilliant.</p>

Wth a crush percolating, person A comes up with a flimsy excuse to see person B (in this case, to borrow a bass guitar). Then bam, B plants a surprise kiss on A—and the rest, as they say, is history. After you listen to the evolutioary history of the world. I dare you not to wnat to sing along when he shouts "A Cambrian Explosion!"</p>
